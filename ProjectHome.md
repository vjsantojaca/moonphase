MoonPhase is a free J2ME application that displays the current moon phase on your mobile phone. It can also display the dates of all new/full moon phases for a given year. The program works on MIDP2 compatible Java-enabled phones, and does not require an Internet connection.

### Features ###
The main screen displays the current moon phase, moon age and percentage of the moon progress.
The percentage value represents the illuminated fraction of the Moon's disc as a value from -99 to +99.

The value is negative when the Moon wanes, and positive otherwise.

The New Moon phase is around 0% and the Full Moon phase is around the +/-99%.

To display the moon phase for a specific date, use the calendar control on the main screen.
